# 👋 Yo, I'm Aleks

### 🧠 Freelance Web Developer & FiveM Scripter from Warsaw

I write code that works.  
I fix things that break.  
And I learn something new doing both.

Currently freelancing out of Warsaw, working with clients who want **real results**, not buzzwords.

---

## 🔧 Tech I'm Into

- Frontend: Vue, Vite, JavaScript, plain old HTML/CSS  
- Backend: Node.js, PHP (yes, still alive), MySQL, REST APIs  
- FiveM: Custom scripts & functional UIs tailored for in-game experiences  
- Dev tools: Git and probably too many VS Code extensions  

---

## 🚀 What I Actually Do

- Build fast & functional web apps  
- Develop and design immersive FiveM scripts with intuitive user interfaces  
- Kill bugs (and occasionally introduce new ones)  
- Make stuff look good on mobile *and* your grandma’s laptop  
- Integrate APIs without crying  
- Keep things simple, clean, and maintainable
